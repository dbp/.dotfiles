Izzy Cecil's Dotfiles
---------------------
Ever wonder how I use my computer?! Well *I* sure do! This repository
is a collection of all config files I use on a regular basis, and
don't feel like loosing any time soon. Feel free to poke around and
use anything that seems interesting.

I manage my dotfiles using the
[rcm | https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm] toolchain. I cannot endorse
this tool enough, it really saves me a bunch of time!

TODO
----
I am in the process of migrating my emacs setup to use use-package. I
need to remeber to finish doing this.
